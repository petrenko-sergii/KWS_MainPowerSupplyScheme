Good day! I have attached the power supply scheme of the big German corn seed complex “KWS”,  
which I have projected (pdf file). It has not much common with the coding but it shows (I hope so)  
that I can think globally in the engineering. To make this scheme I needed to handle with  
the huge amount of electrical capacities and merge them into one main supply scheme.
